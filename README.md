# Short Bio

I am Andy Petrella, an entrepreneur with a Mathematics and Distributed Data background focused on unleashing unexploited business potentials leveraging new technologies in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive systems. 

I am having fun being involved in the data community, first, as an early evangelist of Apache Spark (2011-), then with the [Spark Notebook](https://github.com/spark-notebook/spark-notebook) (2013-), and as public speaker at various events (Spark Summit, Strata, Big Data Spain). 

Also, I enjoy being an O'Reilly author and trainer on subjects like Distributed Data Science, Data Lineage Essentials, Data Governance, and Machine Learning Model Monitoring.

Last but not least, I am cofounder and CEO of [Kensu](https://kensu.io), bringing the Data Intelligence Management (DIM) Platform for data-driven companies to leverage AI sustainably, with Analytics Observability capability coupled to a Data Usage Catalog. Although the Kensu Platform is proprietarty, you can find our open source projects on this [repo](https://github.com/kensuio-oss/).
